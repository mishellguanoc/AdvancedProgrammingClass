Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness means marking methods as "const" when they do not modify the internal state of an object. 
    It is important because it prevents unintended modifications and allows objects to be used in a read-only 
    context, improving code safety and readability.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. es, my class is const-correct because all getter methods are marked as "const", meaning they do not modify 
    the object. Additionally, the private function "determineCategory()" is also const since it only reads 
    the object's attributes without changing them.
